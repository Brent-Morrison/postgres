# Stock Master

The "Stock Master" database collates fundamental and price data for US stocks.  

Data is collected from:
* the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), via the Financial Statement Data Sets made available by the [Economic and Risk Analysis Office](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html), and
* the [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API

This repo contains Python, R and SQL scripts for interacting with the PostgreSQL database housing this data.

## Update procedures

### Monthly

1. Import price data with ```alphavantage_import.py```
2. Import fundamental data with ```edgar_import.py```
3. Transform the raw SEC data with the ```edgar.edgar_fndmntl_all_vw``` view, inserting the results into ```edgar.edgar_fndmntl_all_tb``` table
4. Derive technical indicators from the price data and insert into  ```access_layer.return_attibutes``` table with the R script ```return_attibutes.R```
5. Derive financial ratios and valuation metrics from the fundamental data and insert into the  ```access_layer.fndmntl_attibutes``` table with the R script ```fndmntl_attibutes.R```

### New calendar year

In addition to monthly data collection, the "universe" of stocks for which analysis is performed requires updating.  The universe of stocks is determined with reference to fundamental data as of Q3 of the preceding year.  The following steps are required prior to updating data in a new calendar year:
* Update the ```reference.fundamental_universe``` table with data derived from the function ```edgar.edgar_fndmntl_fltr_fn``` function, parameterised as appropriate.  

## Date reporting conventions

The date at which data is available for modeling often differs to the release date, and in the case of financial statement information, the fiscal period to which it relates.  This necessitates careful tracking of a number of different dates.  Date reporting conventions are as follows.  

##### Report date
The ending date of the fiscal period to which a piece of financial information relates.  Applies only to financial statement information. Labelled ```report_date```.
    
##### Publish date  
The date on which financial statement information is made available to the public.  Labelled ```publish_date```. 
  
##### Capture date
The date data was downloaded.  Labelled ```capture_date```.

##### Date stamp
The date at which information is available for analysis. Labelled ```date_stamp```. 

An example of date reporting for financial statement information taken from the SEC website.   IBM filed it's 30 June 2020 quarterly results on 28 July 2020 (note that it reported EPS on 20 July per the AlphaVantage earnings data).  This information was made available by the SEC in its 2020 Q3 data set on 1 October 2020 and was downloaded on 5 October 2020.  In this case the reporting dates will look like this.

| Date reference        | Date       |
| --------------------- |:----------:|
| ```report_date```     | 2020-06-30 |
| ```publish_date```    | 2020-07-28 |
| ```capture_date```    | 2020-10-05 |
| ```date_stamp```      | 2020-10-31 |

The months subsequent to October 2020, and preceding the capture date of the next quarters financial statements, will have identical reporting, publish and capture dates.  

## Attribute names    
The table below shows attributes codes and descriptions.

| Attribute code        | Attribute description         |
| --------------------- |:------------------------------|
| rtn_ari_1m_dcl        | 1 month arithmetic return     |
| amihud_1m_dcl         | "amihud" illiquidity measure  |
| vol_ari_20d_dcl       | volatility  of 1 day arithmetic returns |
| skew_ari_120d_dcl     | skewness of 1 day arithmetic returns |
| cor_rtn_1d_mkt_120d_sctr_dcl | correlation of 1 day returns with the S&P500 index |
| beta_rtn_1d_mkt_120d_sctr_dcl | beta of 1 day returns with the S&P500 index |

Each of these attributes are discretised into deciles.  These deciles have ```_dcl``` appended.  Some attributes have also been assigned to deciles by industry group.  These are appended with ```_sctr_dcl```.  The first decile is the lowest value of the attribute in question.  Ordering has not been aligned to the consensus view of the attribute / factor effect. 

## Development

| Description | Status |
|:----------|:-------|
| Earnings data update script, ```alphavantage_import.py```, to reference last request time via the  ```capture_date``` field in order to filter out prior requests not returning data. This will entail adding ```capture_date``` to the ```alpha_vantage.tickers_to_update``` view and updating logic at line 117. | TO DO |
| Load edgar ```pre.txt``` file in order to accurately capture balance sheet and income statement line items using the ```stmt``` field | TO DO |
| Append the pre 2012 "universe" to the ```alpha_vantage.monthly_fwd_rtn``` table.  These are stocks that are not returned in the SEC edgar data, and are ranked by dollar volume for inclusion. | TO DO |
| Get industry / sector data for stocks pre 2012 that are not returned in the SEC edgar data. | TO DO |
| Size ranking uses a combination of total equity and total assets by financial and non-financial stocks.  Winsorise minimum of total equity at 5% of total assets.  This will negate the impact of negative equity stocks, when the negative equity is driven by buybacks.  see ticker MCD for example. | TO DO |
